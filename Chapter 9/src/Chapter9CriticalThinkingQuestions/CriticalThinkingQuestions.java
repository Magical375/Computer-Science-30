1 what index value does the third element of an array have? 2
2 Write the declaration for an array named quantities that stores 20 integers. 
int[] quantities = new int[20]; 
3 Write a declaration for an array named heights storing the numbers 1.65,2.15,and 4.96
double [] heights = {"1.65","2.15","4.96"}
4 Write a for-each statement that displays the integer values stored in an array named grades. 
for(string element : grades)
{
System.out.println(element);
}
5 write an algorithm for inserting data into an array so that existing data is moved up one position to make room for the new data. 
add(int 0, object element);
5b Write an algorithm for deleting data from an array so that existing data is moved to close the gap made by the deleted data. 
ArrrayList<String> myStrings = new ArrayList<String>();
myStyrings.add("Bob");
myStrings.add("Sarah");
myStrings.add("Steve");
myStrings.remove(1);
for (String name : myStrings){
System.out.println(name);}
displays 
Bob 
Steve
6 How does passing an entire array to a method differ from passing a single element of the array?
passing a whole array to a method passes the reference to the elements, allowing the method to access an element of the array and change its value. 
passing a single element passes only the data stored and not a reference to the data location.
7 why are offset array indexes required in some cases?
To store something directly corresponding to their outcome. 
8 What output is displayed by the statements below?
String name = "Elaine";
System.out.println(name.charAt(3));
displays i
